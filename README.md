Paper-and-Pens
===============

This is a simple text-based adventure/rpg game develop in Android. It has a simple job system where the user have a choice three class
rogue, warrior, and mage. The UI is choice based so the user will choose one of the four options on given situation. It has a turn-based 
battle much like the old JRPGs though it's not implemented to the program yet. 

The reason is to learn Android and to have fun in working.
